# About me


**luzenkoaleks/luzenkoaleks** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
-Figuring out a roadmap of how to become a programmer, trying things out as I go in a rather random order based on pieces of information that I've collected about the topic, while contemplating the possibility of branching off into a possible career in the field
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- I started earlier this week with learning the basics of how to use WSL, which was quite interesting since I've never used Linux or a terminal before. Now, I'm trying to get a grasp on how to use Git and GitHub. I'm not sure if the analogy fits, but I thought I'd figure out the infrastructure before trying to build a bicycle. Later on, I will take a deep dive into HTML/CSS/JavaScript and try to build a website for a project I have thought about in the past.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- I guess I should first learn the basics and get an understanding of how things work.
